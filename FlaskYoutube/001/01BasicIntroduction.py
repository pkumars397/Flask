Website -> something which open on browser
webapp->intract with user interface forms search etc.

Framework-> provide more power with prebuild things. (readymade gate)

WHy ,what ,how to learn any new things.

HTTP ->  postoffice way ->> message->request address->URL reply->response without secruty

How web works 

FOOd->  request by browser(GET,POST)
Waiter takes order-> server receives request
Cooking -> Process request
waiter brings food -> server sends back a response(json)
Eat -> browser display response as webpage

status code will tell ur request worked or failed
200 -> OK ,everything well
404 ->Not Found ,Page doesn't exist
500 ->Internal server error
301 ->Moved permanently, Page moved to another URl 
403 ->Forbidden, Not allowed to see this

Browser->Client (req->response->show)
URL -> uniform resource locator /websource (webpage address)

Python cann't intract with webpage we can only write logic functions etc.
