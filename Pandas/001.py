#Pandas for data manipulation and analysis

#read write ,csv, excel etc. 

#Three main data structures:
#Series: 1D labeled array capable of holding any data type
#DataFrame: 2D labeled data structure with columns of potentially different types
#Panel: 3D labeled data structure (deprecated)

#allow us to analyze big data sets and make sense of them.
#Dataset merging and joining.
#Columns can be added or deleted from DataFrame and panel data structures.
